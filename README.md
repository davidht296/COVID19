Exponential case growth analysis

The way daily new COVID-19 case numbers are reported in the media can make it difficult to understand whether 
we all these restrictions are working to get us back on top of the spread, or whether new cases continue to grow 
exponentially. Particularly when numbers are changing rapidly, as we have seen around the world, and recently here 
in Victoria.

With so much at stake in regard to lives, livelihoods and the broader economy, it is important for authorities to 
quickly understand where case numbers are heading, and to see whether the restrictions and other public health 
measures being taken to slow the virus are making any real progress.
